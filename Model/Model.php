/**
 * Model
 *
 * Models are a base part of the Model-View-Controller pattern. The model is
 * responsible for collecting and manipulating data. Models are created by extending
 * the \Model class.
 *
 * Note: Many frameworks see the model as a database binding with a specific database table.
 * In KoolDevelop there is no database connection. Extend \KoolDevelop\Model\ContainerModel for
 * this purpose.
